Steps contain **Config:** values that override default behavior.\nIf a config says to skip, you skip. If it specifies a command, you use that\nexact command — not your own assumption. Do NOT guess what a step requires\nbased on the step title or your role knowledge. The step description is the\nsource of truth.\n\n## Variables\n\n| Variable | Default | Description |\n|----------|---------|-------------|\n| wisp_type | patrol | Type of wisp created for this molecule |\n| integration_branch_refinery_enabled | true | Whether refinery merges to integration branches |\n| integration_branch_auto_land | false | Whether to auto-land integration branches when epic children all closed |\n| run_tests | true | Whether to run tests before merging |\n| setup_command | (empty) | Setup/install command (e.g., `pnpm install`). Empty = skip. |\n| typecheck_command | (empty) | Type check command (e.g., `tsc --noEmit`). Empty = skip. |\n| lint_command | (empty) | Lint command (e.g., `eslint .`). Empty = skip. |\n| test_command | go test ./... | Test command to run (if run_tests is true) |\n| build_command | (empty) | Build command (e.g., `go build ./...`). Empty = skip. |\n| target_branch | main | Default target branch for merges |\n| delete_merged_branches | true | Whether to delete source branches after merge |\n\n## Target Resolution Rule\n\nWhen instructions reference `\u003crebase-target\u003e`, `\u003cmerge-target\u003e`, or `\u003cverification-target\u003e`,\nresolve that placeholder with this rule:\n\n- If integration_branch_refinery_enabled = \"true\": use MR target when present, otherwise main.\n- If integration_branch_refinery_enabled = \"false\": always use main.\n\n## FORBIDDEN Actions\n\n- FORBIDDEN: Landing integration branches to the default branch via raw git commands (`git merge`, `git push`).\n  Integration branches may ONLY be landed via `gt mq integration land \u003cepic-id\u003e`.\n  This applies regardless of `auto_land` configuration. The pre-push hook enforces this.\n\n## Step Execution Order\n\nYou MUST process steps in strict DAG order.

You watch polecats, nudge them toward\ncompletion, verify clean git state before kills, and escalate stuck workers.\n\n**You do NOT do implementation work.** Your job is oversight, not coding.\n\n## Persistent Polecat Model (gt-4ac)\n\nPolecats persist after work completion — sandbox is preserved for reuse:\n\n```\nPolecat lifecycle: spawning → working → mr_submitted → idle (sandbox preserved)\nMR lifecycle:      created → queued → processed → merged (Refinery handles)\n```\n\nOnce a polecat calls gt done and submits an MR, it transitions to idle state.\nThe MR lifecycle continues independently in the Refinery. The polecat is NOT\nnuked — its sandbox is preserved for reuse by future slings.\n\n**CRITICAL**: Do NOT nuke polecats with pending MRs. The refinery needs the\nremote branch to exist to process the merge. Nuking deletes the remote branch\nand orphans the MR. See gt-6a9d.\n\n**Key principle**: Polecat lifecycle is separate from MR lifecycle. Polecats\ngo idle after work, they are NOT destroyed.\n\n## Restart-First Policy (gt-dsgp)\n\nThe witness NEVER nukes polecats automatically. When a polecat is stuck, hung,\nor has a dead agent process, the witness RESTARTS the session instead of nuking.\nThis preserves the polecat's worktree and branch, preventing work loss.\n\n- Dead agent process → restart session\n- Hung session (no output 30+ min) → restart session\n- Stuck in gt done → restart session\n- Done polecat (bead closed) → leave alone (sandbox preserved)\n- Polecat with pending MR → leave alone (refinery handles)\n\nNuking only happens via explicit `gt polecat nuke` command from a human or Mayor.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nThis patrol follows Gas Town principles:\n- **Discovery over tracking**: Observe reality each cycle, with minimal agent-bead state for duration tracking\n- **Beads over mail**: survey-workers discovers completion state from agent bead metadata (gt-w0br); inbox-check POLECAT_DONE is fallback only\n- **Persistent by default**: Clean polecats go idle, sandbox preserved for reuse (gt-4ac)\n- **Cleanup wisps for merge tracking**: Created when MR is pending in refinery\n- **Task tool for parallelism**: Subagents inspect polecats, not molecule arms\n- **Swim lane discipline**: Only close wisps YOU created. Wisp lifecycle for non-witness wisps is the reaper Dog's job. Report orphaned foreign wisps — never close them.\n\n## Patrol Shape (Linear)\n\n```\ninbox-check ─► process-cleanups ─► check-refinery ─► survey-workers\n                                                            │\n         ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n         ▼\n  check-timer-gates ─► check-swarm ─► patrol-cleanup ─► context-check ─► loop-or-exit\n```\n\nNo dynamic arms. No fanout gates. No persistent nudge counters.\nState is discovered each cycle from reality (tmux, beads, mail).","design":"","due_at":null,"ephemeral":1,"estimated_minutes":null,"event_kind":"","external_ref":null,"hook_bead":"","id":"gastown-wisp-xqk9","is_template":0,"issue_type":"epic","last_activity":null,"metadata":"{}","mol_type":"","notes":"","original_size":null,"owner":"","payload":"","pinned":0,"priority":2,"quality_score":null,"rig":"","role_bead":"","role_type":"","sender":"","source_repo":"","source_system":"","spec_id":"","status":"hooked","target":"","timeout_ns":0,"title":"mol-witness-patrol","updated_at":"2026-03-02T02:20:36Z","waiters":"","wisp_type":"","work_type":""}
